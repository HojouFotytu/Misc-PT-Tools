This tool will help you do the calculations to move funds from a pair in a downtrend to a pair in an uptrend.

Using some basic technical analysis skills, find coins in a strong up-trend or ready to make a move up (bouncing off support, making a breakout, etc).

You will sell your bag that is stuck in a downtrend, then transfer those funds to coin(s) in an uptrend.  You can also pread it across more than one coin pair to diversify your risk, and improve your chances of recovery.

This tool will calculate how many of the new coins you need to buy, and the new bought prices you'll need to set in PT's, in order to break-even.
**NOTE:** You can only set a new bought price for a pair if USE_BOT_PRICE_CALCULATION = true

Below are the results after one day, when splitting a bag that was -23% across five different coins.  Notice this also allows DCA to activate on smaller "pieces" to help with recovery.
