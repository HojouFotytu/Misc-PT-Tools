This tool will help you do the calculations to move funds from a pair in a downtrend to a pair in an uptrend.

Using some basic technical analysis skills, find coins in an up-trend or ready to make a move up (bouncing off support, making a breakout, etc).

Sell your bag that is stuck in a downtrend, then transfer those funds to one or more coins currently in an uptrend.  Spreading it across more than one coin pair is a nice way to diversify your risk, and improve your chances of recovery.

You can use this tool to calculate how much of the new coins you need to buy, and the new sell prices you'll need to set in PT's hotconfig, in order to break-even.

Yellow fields should be filled with the appropriate values.

Below are the results one day after splitting a a -23%, $500 bag across five different coins.  Notice this also allows DCA to activate on smaller "pieces" to help with recovery.
